This is the methodology for batch prepping boiled eggs that I have found to be the most effective.

I've not had problems with the eggs going bad in under a week to a week and a half.

The ice water seems to help with the peeling. This is the same reason that the baking soda is added but I'm not sure if there is any evidence it is doing anything, just what seems to work for me.
